# DEVELOP AN AUGMENTED BAYESIN MODEL TO PREDICT EQTL BY INTERGRATING DATA FROM MULTIPLE TISSUES 

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses detect genetic variations (SNPs) associated with the expression of genes. The conventional eQTL analysis is to perform individual tests for each gene-SNP pair using simple linear regression. The conventional eQTL study is performed on each tissue separately and ignores the extensive information known about SNPs in other tissue(s). Although Bayesian models have been recently developed to improve eQTL prediction on multiple tissues, they were often based on uninformative priors Â and/or only evaluated on the number of discoveries in simulated or real data. In this study, we develop a novel tissue augmented Bayesian model for eQTL analysis (TA-eQTL), which takes prior eQTL information from a different tissue into account to better predict eQTL within a tissue. It has been demonstrated that our modified Bayesian model has better performance than several existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity using liver allele-specific expression (ASE) as the gold standard. In addition, compared with other methods, our tissue augmented Bayesian model improves the power and accuracy for cis-eQTL prediction especially when sample size on a tested tissue is small.
